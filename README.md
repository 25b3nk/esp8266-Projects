# ESP8266 Projects
A collection of projects and experiments using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module.

## Getting Started

The ESP8266 is a cost-effective and highly integrated Wi-Fi MCU (microcontroller unit) designed for IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It features a 32-bit Tensilica processor and is engineered for mobile devices, wearable electronics, and various other IoT projects that require Wi-Fi connectivity. One of its key features is its power-saving architecture, making it suitable for battery-powered applications.

### Prerequisites

To start working on projects with the ESP8266, you'll typically need the following:

#### Hardware
*   **ESP8266 Module/Development Board:** There are various modules (like the ESP-WROOM-02D/02U) and development boards (such as the ESP8266-DevKitC, NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini) available. Development boards usually include a USB-to-serial adapter and are easier to get started with.
*   **USB-to-Serial Adapter:** If you're using a bare module, you'll need a USB-to-serial adapter (e.g., FTDI FT232RL or CP2102) to program and communicate with the ESP8266.
*   **Power Supply:** A stable 3.3V power supply for the ESP8266. Most development boards can be powered via USB.
*   **Breadboard and Jumper Wires:** For prototyping circuits.
*   **Basic Electronic Components:** Depending on the project, you might need LEDs, resistors, sensors, etc.

#### Software
*   **Arduino IDE with ESP8266 Core:** This is one of the most popular ways to program the ESP8266. You'll need to install the Arduino IDE and then add the ESP8266 board support package.
    *   Instructions: Can be found on the official ESP8266 Arduino Core GitHub page. (We can add a link later if desired).
*   **Espressif ESP8266 SDK:** For more advanced development, you can use the official SDK from Espressif. This provides more direct access to the chip's features but has a steeper learning curve.
*   **Text Editor/IDE:** Your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code with PlatformIO IDE extension, Sublime Text).
*   **Drivers:** Ensure you have the necessary drivers installed for your USB-to-serial adapter.
